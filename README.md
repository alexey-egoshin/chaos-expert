# Chaos Expert
Windows program for research dynamic chaos and prediction of stochastic signals (time-series) on C#.
It's program part of the dissertation for Ph.D. "Analysis and prediction of composite stochastic signals based on methods of a separation boundaries of an implementation of dynamic systems".
Program allows calculate R/S analysis, the Hurst exponent, Lyapunov exponents, normalize time-series, predict & classify for prediction by multi-layer perceptron.
